Hi, Iâ€™m @ozanakgoz. I'm a mechanical engineer who aims to create a toolset of his own. I mainly use excel (and sometimes python) for my tasks and projects. Often, i have to choose between VBA (for better usage by my colleauges) and python notebooks (due its powerful libraries). As these options limits usability of my works, i decided to develop my skills to create cross-platform gui applications. My aim is to create a cross-platform gui application for planning&scheduling tasks, scenario evaluations, risk assessments and finally reporting of those with beautiful dashboards and visualizations for each task. I want it to be modular so that extra capabilities (performance calculations, cost evaulations and predictions) can be added with modules.

Currently, i'm learning front-end development, at the same time, i'm creating my shipment planning and scheduling tool together with learning process. Hoping to start to learn& develop back-end part of my project since i want it to be used by my colleauges simultaneously.

I'm also interested with data mining and machine learning. Have some projects in my mind but they have to wait their turn. One step at a time.
